# Demo-icassp2022
This repository contains the demo, separated audio signals, of our proposed algorithm submitted to ICASSP 2022 and other blind source separation algorithms.
# Our paper
He, Yudong, He Wang, Qifeng Chen, and Richard HY So. "Harvesting Partially-Disjoint Time-Frequency Information for Improving Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique." In ICASSP 2022-2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 506-510. IEEE, 2022.
# Matlab code is available!
We have open-sourceed our Matlab codes for all blind source algorithms that we used in our paper.
